![downloads](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/Penguin-Spy/replugged-ppl-moe/latest/total?color=ff69b4&logo=github) [![Install for Replugged](https://img.shields.io/badge/Replugged-Install-7289da?logo=discord&logoColor=fff)](https://replugged.dev/install?source=github&identifier=Penguin-Spy/replugged-ppl-moe)  
This is a [Replugged](https://replugged.dev/) plugin that displays a user's [ppl.moe](https://ppl.moe/) profile as a new tab in the user's modal.  
It also shows users' pronouns next to the username in messages.  

# Features
- A new tab in the user modal that displays a user's ppl.moe profile (if they have one).
- Displays a user's pronouns in the message header.
- Automatically hides PronounDB's pronouns if there are ppl.moe ones to show (optional).
- Settings can be configured in the Replugged Plugins settings tab.
- A user context menu button to link to a user's profile on the website.
- ~~A new Discord connection that links to the profile on the ppl.moe website~~
- ~~Shows a cute little badge next to a user's name in chat messages if they have a profile~~
- ~~Optional tab icon (instead of text) for theme consistency~~

# Known Issues
The first time you open a user modal after reloading, the tab button will not appear. Simply re-open the modal to fix this. I don't believe it is possible to fix this. (i've tried with `forceUpdateElement`, it didn't work?).  
If you encounter any issues *with the features that are curently implemented*, [please open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/Penguin-Spy/replugged-ppl-moe/issues).

# Installation
## Replugged
Click [here](https://replugged.dev/install?source=github&identifier=Penguin-Spy/replugged-ppl-moe) to install the latest version.

## Other client mods
I may write a version for [Aliucord](https://github.com/Aliucord/Aliucord "A Discord mod for Android") at some point.  
This plugin will never support BetterDiscord/BandagedDiscord or whatever people are calling it this week. (it's the Minecraft Forge of Discord mods)
