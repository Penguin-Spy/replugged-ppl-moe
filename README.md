# replugged ppl.moe
![clones](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://githubstats.penguinspy.repl.co/shields/replugged-ppl-moe) [![Replugged](https://img.shields.io/badge/client-Replugged-7289da?logo=discord&logoColor=fff)](https://replugged.dev/)  
This is a [replugged](https://replugged.dev/) plugin that displays a user's [ppl.moe](https://ppl.moe/) profile as a new tab in the user's modal.  
~~It also shows their pronouns next to their name in messages~~ (~~similar to & compatible with the [PronounDB](https://pronoundb.org/) plugin~~).  
 
# Features
- A new tab in the user modal that displays a user's ppl.moe profile ~~(if they have one)~~
- ~~A new connection that links to the profile on the ppl.moe website~~
- ~~Displays a user's pronouns in the message header~~, ~~just like the [PronounDB plugin](https://github.com/cyyynthia/pronoundb-powercord)~~
- ~~Automatically hides PronounDB's pronouns if there are ppl.moe ones to show (optional)~~
- ~~Shows a cute little badge next to a user's name in chat messages if they have a profile~~
- ~~Optional tab icon (instead of text) for theme consistency~~

# Known Issues
None, if you encounter any issues *with the features that are curently implemented*, [please open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/Penguin-Spy/replugged-ppl-moe/issues).

# Installation
## Replugged
todo: github workflow to bundle the plugin & release it.  
for now just `git clone`, `pnpm i`, `pnpm run update` to install it into the replugged plugin folder (and `git pull` & `pnpm run update` to get new changes)

## Other client mods
I may write a version for [Aliucord](https://github.com/Aliucord/Aliucord "A Discord mod for Android") at some point.  
This plugin will never support BetterDiscord/BandagedDiscord or whatever people are calling it this week. (it's the Minecraft Forge of Discord mods)
